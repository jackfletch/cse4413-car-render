# CSE 4413 Assignment 3 and 4: Vertex and Fragment Processing

This project is from assignments 3 and 4 of a computer graphics class (CSE 4413) at Mississippi State University.

To run, serve `src/a4.html` as a static file or build a docker image using the Dockerfile.

## WebGL

The WebGL API is quite complicated so the project uses [`regl`](https://github.com/regl-project/regl), a functional abstration for WebGL.
The `gl-matrix` package is used for matrix math.

## Assignment 3

Assignment 3 implemented a vertex shader.

## Assignment 4

Assignment 4, a continuation of Assignment 3, focused on implementing a fragment shader.
